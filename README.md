# vs-code_dark-theme

A dark theme for your VS Code, easy on the eyes and without neon colors.
For those who want a comfortable experience in their editor,
haven't found a suitable default color theme option,
and don't want to configure it themselves.

Copy/unpack the theme-ashbuk directory into the directory where VS Code color themes are located. 
By default: code / resources / app / extensions

After that, you will be able to select it from the list of available themes in the command palette or the extensions tab.
